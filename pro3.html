                Top-k queries have wide applications in a big data setting.
One of the simplest and easy-to-grasp application is election
which precisely capture the notion of “global” and “local”
counts of votes. In a large-scale election, each ballot box has
a local count of votes for each candidate (or item); however,
what we really care about is the global counts of votes, i.e.,
the aggregation of all the local votes. More precisely, a top-k
query should find the answer to the following question:
Which are the k globally most popular candidates?
This has many natural applications in large-scale big data
systems. Due to its wide applications, efficient Top-k
mechanisms have been a hot research topic.In this paper, we first formally analyze the Lottery Algorithm
in [6], and address the two limitations by proposing
a modular algorithm. The first stage of the algorithm selects
a constant number of “popular” items in a similar fashion
of the Lottery Algorithm [6], and the second stage uses a
modular approach to output the Top-k items from the popular
items selected in the first stage. One salient feature of the
modular approach is that depending on the characteristics of
the data, we can plug in different existing Top-k algorithms
into the second stage to produce the output to obtain better
approximation bound. This is particularly beneficial if we have
some prior knowledge on the characteristics of the data, e.g.,
distribution of local counts of votes or communication graph.
Our approximate algorithm is also lightweight, works in sparse
networks and has better approximation bound.
