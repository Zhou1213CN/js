                Exploring the possibility of predicting hit songs is both interesting from a scientific point
                of view and something that could be beneficial to the music industry. In this research we raise
                the question if it is possible to classify a music track as a hit or a non-hit based on its audio and
                artist features. By training classifiers on the different features, we hope to find patterns in the
                data that will hopefully tell us which features are appealing to people and will result in a song
                becoming popular, or “hit”. We investigated which machine learning algorithms could be suited
                for a task like this. Four different models were built using various algorithms, including K
                Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, as well as Logistic Regression. The
                obtained results do not indicate that it is possible to predict hit songs on our particular dataset.
                (Testing on the full imbalanced data gives us worse results than the resampled data did). The fact
                that we predict most of the songs as hit songs results in a high recall, and precision becomes very
                low because of it. Also, we do not get a conclusion of what the most relevant features are
                because they vary from model to model.)
